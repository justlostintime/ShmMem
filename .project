Description="This provides an interface to the Linux Shared memory functions. Allowing the creation and sharing of shared memory segments across any number of local applications or tasks. Added A gambas script to graphically monitor the Shared Memory.\nNew - Allow Gambas native values to be saved as ShmMem Symbols \n             for loading into an image.\nUpdated Export and import to allow for any type of array content\nBug fix - validate memory before operation.\nAdded Close method then must now be called before application exits, fixes circular refrence and unrelease blocks\nOops, changed back to a library, had to debug as a component\nAdded _read _write serialization for shm datatypes\nBug fix for each with symbols..\nMore bug fixes, updateded web address to go to wiki, online information for shmmem\nNew Added support for executable shared memory segments added ability to load x86 or arm code blocks and execute\n          this allows the application to directly generate JIT raw code and jump to it as a thread on current application\n          The call to execute waits for the threads completion before continuing.\nAdded class ShmValue to create a single value in shared memory\nUpdated Automatically convert Gambas Native arrays to ShmArrays in shared memory. Performace...\nExtended Array, with toCvs FromCvs, import, export, redim, and copy\nUpdated Buf fixes, lists and Arrays\nUpdated to add static arrays of variant values max 10 dimensions.\nUpdated such that array,list ans queues can be access by tag name.\nUpdated to by default use locks for all lists/queues. Lock are localized to the specific list or queue being changed.\nTo do this it implements  an interface which allows any valid gambas object or variable to be directly stored or accessed via the interface\n\nexample::\nPublic Sub Main()\nMyShm = new ShmMem\n\nWith MyShm\n\n !a = \"this\"\n !b = 1\n\nprint !a, !b\n\nend with\nend"
